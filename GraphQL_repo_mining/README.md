# GraphQL_repo_mining

This folder contains scripts and data for mining GitHub repositories using GraphQL queries. It is designed to help users filter, analyze, and extract information about repositories based on various criteria such as stars, development activity, and protocols.

## Folder Structure and File Descriptions

- **mine_repo.py**: Main Python script for mining repositories using the GitHub GraphQL API. It contains logic to query repositories, process results, and save output data.
- **filter_repo.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for filtering and analyzing mined repository data. Useful for interactive data exploration and applying custom filters to the output CSV files.
- **output/**: Directory containing CSV files generated by the mining and filtering scripts. 

## Usage

1. **Mining Repositories**
   - Run `mine_repo.py` to query GitHub repositories using the GraphQL API. Configure the script as needed for your mining criteria.
   - Output CSV files will be saved in the `output/` directory.

2. **Filtering and Analysis**
   - Open `filter_repo.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to interactively filter and analyze the mined data.
   - Load the relevant CSV file from the `output/` directory and apply your desired filters or visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required packages (install via pip if needed):
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`

## Notes
- Ensure you have a valid GitHub API token for accessing the GraphQL API.
- Adjust mining parameters in `mine_repo.py` as needed for your research or analysis goals.
- The output CSV files may be large depending on the mining scope.
